# About the Project

This project was developed during the Linux Fundamentals Course, made by [Digital Innovation One](https://www.dio.me/). This script updates the Operating System, installs Apache Web Server and Unzip, downloads my [Pokedex Web Page](https://github.com/GabrielFerreiraDoPrado/Pokedex) and unzips it, then finally copies the files into the web server folder, so it is possible to access the page locally.

## Objectives
 
• Create a shell script to iniciate a Web Server

• Study Linux Server

# Tools

• Apache HTTP Server
